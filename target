AUTOENCODER: a list of networks. the most inner network 
(smallest in dimension) is at the front of the list, and
the outter most network is the last member.

pinpoint the turning point at 300 [in progress]

make an api for accessing the reduced form of an input given 
the input vector and the network[in progress]

write an activate-autoencoder function, which takes an autoencoder (list
of networks) and an input vector, and returns the transformed input

perform pca and compare results[ambitious]
